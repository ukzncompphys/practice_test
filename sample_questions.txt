When deriving Simpson's rule, we saw in class that the area under a
parabola dx wide is dx*(f_left+4*f_mid+f_right).  Write a python
routine to integrate 1/(1+x^2) using Simpson's rule from -10 to 10,
but one that accepts as input an arbitrary set of positions for the
bin edges.  You may assume you get f_left/right passed to you, and you
calculate the position of f_mid.  Run with bins that are 0.1 wide
between -1 and 1, and 1 wide otherwise.  Compare that to the answer
with bins 0.1 wide over the entire region from -10 to 10.

multi-dimensional discrete Fourier Transforms are frequently used in
scientific computing.  Write down the equations for a 2-dimensional
DFT.  Show that it can be done as a series of 1-D DFTs.  If you have
an N by M array, how does the operation count for a 2-D FFT scale with
N and M?  You may ignore any multiplicative constants.

for advection, you might think that changing the numerical derivative
from the simple upwind estimate (f(x+dx)-f(x))/dx to one involving the
slope on both sides - [f(x+dx)-f(x-dx)]/2 would be an improvement.
Derive the CFL stability condition for this and show that it is never
stable. 

Let's compare mesh-based and particle-based methods for doing N-body
simulations in two dimensions.  Let's say we have N particles, and
our mesh is m cells on a side, so a total of m^2 cells.  Furthermore,
let's assume that for a mesh-based gravity solver, the work is
dominated by the FFT (i.e. the placing of the N particles onto the
grid is negligible).  Let's say that the total computational work
required for a particle-particle solver is a*f(N), where 'a' is a
constant, and f(N) is some function of N - for instance, if adding new
particles required a linear amount of extra work, f(N) would be equal
to N^1.  What is f(N)?  Next, let the work for the grid-based solver
be bg(m), again for some unknown constant 'b'.  What is g(m)?
Finally, combine these results to find the number of particles at
which the work required for an direct force calculation and a grid
calculation are equal.  If you have more particles than this critical
value, would it be faster to use a grid-based or a direct gravity calculator?

model fitting:  we saw in class that if you have data that depend
linearly on a model, <d>=Am, that chi^2 can be written down as
(d-Am)^T N^-1 (d-Am).  Show that ignoring the noise, this has solution
m=(A^T N^-1 A)^-1 A^T N^-1 d
If we assume the noise is constant, that reduces to 
m=(A^T A)^-1 A^T d.  
This is often used to fit polynomials to data models.  However, for
some classes of functions, other basis sets may be more useful.  
Fit e^-x between 1 and 5 (using at least 100 points) using x^-n for
your basis functions (i.e. columns of A) with n an integer, ranging
from 0 to 5 (i.e. x^0, x^-1...x^-5).  Recall that numpy.dot will do a
matrix multiply of arrays, alternatively numpy.matrix will turn an
array into a matrix.

MCMC:  Take the output Markov chain from the class MCMC example.  As
discuss in class, its power spectrum (the absolute value of its
Fourier transform squared) should be flat at low frequencies and slope
down at high frequencies.  Do ou
